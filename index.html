              <p class ="lead">Known as the Aura Pokémon, Lucario are sensitive to a special type of energy called Aura. The black appendages on the back of their heads are used to detect the Auras of creatures and objects around it. With their ability to sense the Auras in all things around them, they can navigate and track through telepathic methods. They can also guide the waves of an Aura in an offensive manner to create small balls of energy such as Aura Sphere. </p>

              <p class ="lead">Yveltal is a Pokémon that absorbs the life energy of living creatures, acting as a counterpart to Xerneas. Yveltal is also capable of committing one of the most harmful acts ever committed by a Pokémon that has ever been seen in the franchise: when Yveltal is nearing the end of a life cycle, it will absorb the energy of every proximate life form and use it as fuel; that way, this creature can continue living for another thousand years even if it has to revert back to a cocoon. </p>

              <h2>Reshiram</h2>
              <p class ="lead">Reshiram has a jet engine-like tail, which it uses to accelerate itself when flying at high speeds. It can send flames from its tail into the air to incinerate everything around it. By flaring its tail, Reshiram is capable of moving the world's atmosphere and changing the weather. This tail generator is also activated when influenced by either Fusion Bolt or Bolt Strike, which in turn powers up Reshiram's own Fusion Flare or Blue Flare, its signature moves. In Unova mythology, Reshiram sided with the older brother who sought the truth. As a result, it firmly believes in truth. According to one myth, Reshiram is said to burn down kingdoms of people who ignore truth due to being consumed by greed.</p>

              <h2>Ultra Necrozma</h2>
              <p class ="lead">Necrozma was once an entity that spread light across Ultra Space, known as the Blinding One. That was until the residents of Ultra Megalopolis managed to restrain it, imprisoning it within the Megalo Tower, using its light as a source of power. While it was captured, Necrozma was tortured by the people to produce light, enough that it caused a crippling injury that led to the light within itself to consistently leak out. This caused Necrozma to go berserk, resulting in its desire to drain all light from the universe to regain all of the light that it had lost. After stealing the light from Ultra Megalopolis as it escaped its imprisonment, Necrozma went on a rampage stealing all the light from multiple spots throughout Ultra Space. Once it absorbs enough light, Necrozma can undergo a process called Ultra Burst to reclaim its true form: Ultra Necrozma, a colossal dragon of pure light energy. The various pieces of Necrozma's crystalline body are rearranged as a sort of "skeleton" for the rest of Ultra Necrozma's body.</p>
